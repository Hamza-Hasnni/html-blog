          Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use
          of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in
          pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is
          one of the most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events
          in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual
          medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take
          part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of
          four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as
          backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.[2]
